- 🌱 I’m currently learning, even when I think I know something. Especially when I think I know something.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well collaborate is a strong word, but if I can help, or if you can help 
- 📫 How to reach me can you reach someone on github?  I mean message me somehow on here until I figure it out I just don't want to loose these changes.
